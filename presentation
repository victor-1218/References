part 1: introduce can be a fast present because everyone know about it

slide 8: structure of AA machine
 2 inputs: HTCC and VCM; 
 2 outputs: product and NG product
 index table
 4 station: chart, gripper, socket, collimator, OC lamp, UV Led, bufer


slide 9: AA stage-connection: 
 - if one part relating connection of HTCC lost, CCD error-cannot diplay image
 - if one part relating connection of VCM lost, cannot adjust lens moving

slide 11: AA stage-sequence: some items can be changed: 
 VCM Z-axis thru-focus; VCM driving thru-focus; UV; 

slide 12: 
 - Disconnection:
	Reason: air in the glue bottle
	Affect: dust can penetrate inside HTCC
	Fix: centrifuge to remove air bubbles; 
	     remove glue for 30-60 seconds before using
 - Shift:
	Reason: the position of the glue nozzle is misaligned; 
                the align light is misaligned
	Affect: affects components and solder pins
	Fix: adjust the glue nozzle and the align light
	     adjust offset x, y dimensions

slide 14: dispensing test
 - Height:
	Factor affecting: the height between HTCC and glue nozzle
 - Width:
	Factor affecting: pressure

slide 15: rotation
 	Factor affecting: chart - compare image from chart and sensor
 	Reason: - Chart was rotated when installation
 	Fix: difference between A and B is more than 0.5, adjust chart 
             otherwise, adjust offset to to rotate the VCM in the opposite 
	     direction to compensate for the deviation of the chart

slide 16: OC
	Factor affecting: chart
 	Reason: - Chart was tilted during installation
 	Fix: adjust chart 
             adjust offset of OC light

slide 17: BLT
	Factor affecting: Performance of lens and VCM (pre-step) 
 	Reason: cube height is constant, HTCC height is constant
 	Fix: adjust Z offset
             recommend to pre-step

slide 18: cosmetic
 	Factor affecting: chart, gripper, nozzle
 	Reason: 
	- VCM gap: do lens bị nghiêng nên VCM phải bù nghiêng nên một bên thấp
		   một bên cao => bên cao có nguy cơ làm chân terminal không
	 	   chạm HTCC => fix: đặt spec tilt limit; tilt quá thì NG
	- Epoxy: dispensing
	- Lens coating: gripper
	- Rotation: chart
	- Chipping: gripper
 	Fix: adjust gripper height offset
	     adjust chart
	      	     

slide 19: shear	
 	Factor affecting: 
		- Time
		- Temperature (oven); Luminance (UV)
 	Reason: - Chart was tilted during installation
 	Fix: adjust chart 
             adjust offset of OC light
