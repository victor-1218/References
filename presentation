Hello everyone, my fullname is Nguyen Minh Duc, my English name is Victor.
Iam an intership at the NPI1 department, on AA process and my mentor is Mr.Louis.
Today, i will show u about my final presentation.

I will divide the presentation into 4 parts are:
- Part 1: Camera module introduction
- Part 2: Active align process
- Part 3: CTQ Test
- Part 4: Build plan & ERS

The first is about camera module introduction.
Camera module is contructed from some components like VCM, Lens, IRCF, Substrate,
sensor, FPCB and stiffener. Cameras are often used in many fields, including some 
familiar products like Iphone, PC and Tablet. So how to product a camera module ?

In our company, the production process is divided into 2 main section: FOL and EOL.
Both FOL and EOL involve many steps but here I will outline the main steps.

FOL is standfor front of line, includes 6 main steps as u can see.
- Stud Bump: Creating a Gold bump by using ultrasonic 
	    waves to cut and attach the bump to the Sensor's Bond Pad
- Flip Chip: Using ultrasonic waves on the HTCC to attach the sensor
- Underfill: Coating the back of the Sensor 
	    with epoxy glue that has been mounted on the HTCC
- IRCF Attack: Attaching IRCF (IR cut filter) 
	      after coating epoxy on HTCC
- Lens Insertion: Attaching Lens and VCM
- Active Align: Adjusting the sensor and optical 
	      correction of the lens, then attaching the VCM and HTCC

EOL is standfor end of line, also includes 6 main steps.
- Laser Soldering:  Welding the HTCC groove with the AF electrode of
		  the VCM using laser welding equipment
- FPCB Bonding:	    Using ACF device, attaching FPCB after applying
 		  ACF film to ACF Pad on the back of HTCC
- Stiffener Attack: Attaching Stiffener after spraying AG and Thermal 
		  Epoxy on the back of the FPCB Module with ACF attached.
- Stiffener Sidefill: Spraying Ag epoxy into the space 
		  between VCM and Stiffener
- Neck Reinforcement: Using Up Tester, checking for dust, 
		  AF movements and Camera module features
- Laser Making:	     Using Down Tester, performing 
		  calibration of the color features of the image
(1 presentation has 10-15 minutes so if it doesn't enough time, can fast read
the process)

Active align step is the step where iam working on.

In part 2, i will tell you more details about AA process.

This is machine A seen from the outside which is one of the biggest machine. 

There is it's structure that has two inputs (HTCC, VCM), one output, 4 station,
 3 pick up and 1 NG tray.

About flow process, u can see the graph 
HTCC input is sent to the index table where include 4 steps:
- First, HTCC is placed in supply position
- Second, it moves to blow & suction position
- Then, it comes to dispenser to be glued epoxy
- Final, machine check epoxy line inspection.

The loading hand 1's task is to take the HTCC to scan the Barcode 
and place it into the socket.
The loading hand 2's task is to take the VCM to scan the Barcode, 
  cleaning and place it into the buffer.
After that, machine performs AA stage to attaching HTCC and VCM. Then product will
be UV cured and shipped to ouput magazine by unloading hand. During the AA process
, if there is a false product, it will be placed in the NG tray.
The finished product needs to be put into the oven within 2 hours.
Otherwise, the glue will lose its adhesion and damage the product.

About epoxy dispensing, it includes 4 steps as u can see: 
- HTCC Vision Align
- Epoxy Dispensing
- Inspection
- Detect pattern disconnection and shift
The pattern is made up of 16 points which has coordinates and parameters as shown
in the table. And this is the result of machine after align HTCC to detect 
disconnect and shift.

About AA stage connections, there are two main connections: from socket and 
buffer to PC. These hardwares are set up and installed in the AA machine.

Next, AA stage sequence will show more details about active align step: 
- Inputs move to AA stage
- Place HTCC into socket and move to AA position
- VCM Thru-focus 1st: Control the height of the VCM to check the tilt
- Adjust Tilting (Tx, Ty): adjust the height of VCM to tilt compensation
- Corner & SFR check: test center position and 4 corner to check 
  the sharpness of the camera (SFR-spatial frequency response).
- VCM driving Thru-focus (lens): Control the height of the len to check the tilt
- Adjust Tilting: adjust the height of lens to tilt compensation
- Final SFR check: if it is not suitable, product will be come back to step
  VCM driving Thru-focus and be checked again. If it is still NG, it will be 
  moved to NG tray
- OC 1st: check OC and compenstate
- OC 2nd: check OC 2nd 
- UV: to temporarily dry the glue

Come to part 3: CTQ test, i will intro about some measurements
Dispensing test:
- The tool: 3D machine
- There are 2 items to measure: 
	height: Measure the distance from the glue line to the HTCC surface at 
		8 points
	width:  Measure the width of the glue line at 4 locations
- Method: engineer write a program for each items
- Measurement results table: result mesure is showed in the table and 
  If the measured parameters are within spec, the machine settings are 
  appropriate, otherwise the machine settings need to be changed.
	

Rotation test:
- The tool: 3D machine
- Purpose: evaluate deviation between HTCC and VCM in degrees 
- Method: Create two straight lines on the edges VCM and HTCC 
  and measure the angle formed between them
- Stdev (Standard Deviation): A quantity used to reflect the dispersion 
  of values in a data set. Shows the variation of value in a period of 
  time reflecting the trend of change.
- CPK (Process capability index): reflects the deviation of the process average
- The less Stdev, the more CPK, the better process capability.

OC test:
- The tool: OC test machine
- Check the optical center of product after UV
- Method: put product into socket and click start button, machine will 
  automaticly measure


BLT test: bonding line thickness
- The tool: 3D machine
- Purpose: calculate thickness of glue after attaching HTCC and VCM through
  VCM Shield Height, HTCC Height and Cube Height. 
- Calculation formula is as shown in the picture


Cosmetic:
- Check external inspection of the product
- Some issues: 
	VCM gap: VCM is not connected to HTCC
	Epoxy: disconnect, overflow
	Lens coating:Check the Lens for scratches using a microscope with a 
	 flash light underneath the Lens
	VCM Rotation: HTCC protrudes above VCM (measurement by machine is not 100%) 
	Lens chipping:Check the Barrel for scratches
- 2 ways to measure: Visually inspect and 3D machine

Shear strength test:
- The tool: shear machine
- Measure the force that destroys the glue layer between HTCC and VCM.
  There are 2 items that need to be measured: after UV and after oven
- The table show some parameters as u can see 

Final, part 4 is build plan and ERS
Build plan: 
- In AA process, there are 3 main points about job of engineer: 
   Project progress control: follow and update the build plan from PM,
   Output quality control.
   Innovation and increase quality of process
The working process with 1 model is as follows: 
 Set up the AA machine=>Run MBO and complete MBO report
=>Submit MBO and ACE Approval=>Set up and run main=>PBO report

ERS:
- The ERS stands for engineering requirements specification, this document is 
  detail descriptions and obligated parameters which Apple company needs.
- There are 18 parameters
- The items tested in part 3 are all based on ERS.

Question:
1. Slide 12, why do point 15, 16 take no pressure?
2. SC_South Carolina
3. After UV treatment, the glue will temporarily harden and maintain for 2 hours
4. The reason why dividing FOL and EOL is in FOL HTCC and VCM have not been put 
together yet so the possibility of dust contamination on the camera (IRCF, sensor) 
during the FOL process is more than EOL. 
5. Spec OC in AA machine is +-5 (pixel), in OC tester is +-35 (pixel)
